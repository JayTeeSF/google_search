## What?
(hacked) google SEO-rank searcher

## Why?
See where your site's first-page shows-up in results for a particular search

## Woah...
IANAL, but proceed with caution: use this software at your own risk. Just assume
it's as likely to melt your machine as it is to do whatever I say below.

# Setup

#### [Option 1] Build the binary (i.e. from this source)
```
crystal build searcher.cr --release
```

#### [Option 2] Download the binary & chmod it...
```
visit: https://github.com/JayTeeSF/google_search/blob/master/searcher?raw=true

In your terminal (after holding-down cmd-spacebar and entering: "terminal")
cd ~/Downloads      # navigate to where you downloaded it
chmod +x ./searcher # make it executable
```

#### [Option 3] Use the Ruby version of the searcher
Instead of `./searcher`, as per below, you'll use `ruby ./searcher.rb`
[setting-up ruby is an exercise for the reader]

### Action

#### Without any options it fails due to any missing required-param(s):
```
↪ ./searcher
Missing hash key: :query (KeyError)
[4341694773] *Hash(Symbol, String | Int32 | Bool)@Hash(K, V)#[]<Hash(Symbol, String | Int32 | Bool), Symbol>:(String | Int32 | Bool) +773
[4341637680] __crystal_main +10112
[4341672635] main +43
```

#### Check the Help to figure it out:
```
↪ ./searcher --help
Usage: searcher.cr [OPTIONS]...
    -r, --run                        Run
    -u [USER_AGENT], --user_agent [USER_AGENT]User Agent
    -m [MAX_PAGES], --max_pages [MAX_PAGES]Max Pages
    -t [TARGET], --target_site [TARGET]Target Site
    -q [QUERY], --query [QUERY]      Query
    -d, --debug                      Debug Mode
    -h, --help                       This help screen

    e.g. searcher.cr -d -m 10 -r -u "Mozilla" -t "www.mycompany.com" --query="find anatomy flashcards"
```

#### Run it:
```
↪ ./searcher --debug --max_pages 10 --run --user_agent "Mozilla" --target_site "www.some-company.com" --query="your search terms"

running with: {:debug => true, :action => "run", :user_agent => "Mozilla", :target_site => "www.some-company.com", :query => "your search terms"}

curl -A  -XGET "http://www.google.com/search?start=60&hl=en&q=your%20search%20terms"
curl -A  -XGET "http://www.google.com/search?start=70&hl=en&q=your%20search%20terms"
curl -A  -XGET "http://www.google.com/search?start=80&hl=en&q=your%20search%20terms"
curl -A  -XGET "http://www.google.com/search?start=90&hl=en&q=your%20search%20terms"
curl -A  -XGET "http://www.google.com/search?start=100&hl=en&q=your%20search%20terms"
not found in 3,630,000,000 total results
```

#### Review the results:
At this point you'll also have a file on your filesystem with a log of the results, e.g.:
```

### TO-DONE:
  A Ruby Nokogiri-based solution
  Switch to Regex's (Chomsky who?)
    Why?  Famous Last Words: "Because we're parsing for simple patterns from pages with a consistent format"

  Generate a binary that anyone (i.e. non-rubyists) can use (the real reason for removing the Nokogiri dependency)
